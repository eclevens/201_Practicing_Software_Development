 Goals:
 * Make a phone book that can handle user input.
 * Add person with number
 * Delete person by name
 * Display entire phone book
 * Search phone book by name and return result

The above goals represent our brainstorming (we didn't make a seperate document since the info needed to be most readily available here.
Brainstorming was done as a team to determine these goals.
Olivia: Build Main() code for phone book and helper functions to handle user input and call the rest of the program.
Mariana: Build functions to add and delete contacts.
Ella: Build function to display the entire phone book.
Jacob: Build function to search the phone book for a specific contact.
